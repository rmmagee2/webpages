<p>Hello, my name is <em>Ryan Magee</em>

<p style="font-family:courier;" style="font-size:20px;" style="font-color:#00FF00;" >
As for my "job", I used to work at a local restraunt in my hometown called Cypress Hall Kitchen and Bar. It was a great job as I made good money through tips and also built great cusomer service skills by fulfilling the needs of customers. 
	  It was hard to do this somtimes though as people can ask questions that you really have to think about your response and word it carefully. 
	  Working in this enviorment while not the most fun, has defintley given me usefull skills and helped devolp me overall as a person.
